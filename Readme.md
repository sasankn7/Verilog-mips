## Design and develop a classic 5 stage pipeline MIPS 32-bit processor.

The code consists of several Verilog modules that define the different components of the processor, including the instruction memory, register file, ALU, and control unit.

The `mips_top` module is the top-level module that integrates all of the other modules and connects them to the input and output ports. It defines the pipeline stages and the pipeline registers, and implements the combinational and sequential logic for each stage.

The `mips_control` module is responsible for decoding the instructions and generating the control signals that control the behavior of the other components.

The `mips_memory` module is a simple memory module that implements the instruction and data memories of the processor.

The `mips_alu` module is an arithmetic and logical unit that performs the calculations specified by the instructions.


Overall, this code implements the basic functionality of a 5 stage pipeline MIPS processor, including instruction fetch, decode, execute, memory, and write-back stages. It is a basic implementation that does not include any forwarding or stalling mechanisms to handle data hazards.

`irmm` is the instruction Module. It will load the instructions file."# Verilog-mips"
